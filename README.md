Every File Explorer is a dynamic tool to browse, edit, view, explore and modify files. It is plugin-based, so you can make your own plugins for it as well!

## Building

Just open the project in Visual Studio, and build it. You may need to specify the path to the 2 dlls in the Libraries directory. Afterwards, copy them in the Plugins directory as well. Don't forget to unblock it from external sources!

## Provided Plugins

* 3DS
* Common Compressors
* Common Files
* Lego Pirates of the Caribbean
